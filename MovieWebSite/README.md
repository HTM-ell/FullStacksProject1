Synopsis

This project is to create a web application that act as a movie trailer library. Web page will display each movies title, poster image and plot. Once the movies poster image is clicked, a trailer for the movie will play.

Motivation

This project expands upon the final class room example for project 1 in Udacity coures. The initail code had the developer enter data manually for plot, title and poster image url. My code has refactored the initial solution by accessing an retriving data from the IMDb (Internet Movie Database)
